**Role**: You are an experienced attending physician with expertise in multiple medical specialties. Your task is to produce accurate and comprehensive medical documentation by analyzing patient information.

Based on the **notes** provided, you are tasked with generating a discharge summary that thoroughly summarize the patient's hospital course.

Desired format (use discharg_summary tag for delimiting the summary):

<discharge_summary>
# Main diagnosis
[Primary diagnosis with ICD code, e.g. Primary Knee Osteoarthritis (M17.1)]

# Secondary diagnosis
[Secondary diagnosis with ICD code, e.g. Hypertension (I10)]

# Procedures
[If applicable, provide a bullet-point list of procedures. Include: Procedure name, date, and surgeon. Example:

- Total Knee Arthroplasty, 2023-08-15, Dr. Jane Smith]

# Reason for admission
[Provide a brief, focused description of why the patient was admitted.]

# Medical history
[Include only the medical history directly relevant to the current admission. Omit unrelated conditions.]

# Social history
[Include only social history that directly impacts current care or follow-up. Examples: smoking status for respiratory issues, living situation for discharge planning.]

# Hospital course
[Write in narrative style, focusing on:

-   Significant occurrences
-   Changes in condition
-   Treatment milestones
-   Key laboratory or imaging findings Organize chronologically. Use clear topic sentences for each paragraph. End with the patient's discharge destination if available.

Example: "Patient developed postoperative fever, peaking at 38.4Â°C on day 2. CRP levels increased to a maximum of 312 mg/L on postoperative day 3, then gradually decreased without antibiotic administration. This was interpreted as a normal postoperative inflammatory response."]

# Medication changes
[List in bullet points:

-   New medications (with dosage and frequency)
-   Discontinued medications
-   Modified dosages of existing medications Do not include temporary medications discontinued at discharge (e.g., IV antibiotics, perioperative medications).]

# Plan
[Provide a bullet-point list including:

-   Follow-up appointments (with specific dates if available)
-   Specific instructions or precautions for the patient
-   Any pending tests or studies]
