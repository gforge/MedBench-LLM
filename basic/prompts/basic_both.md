You are an experienced attending physician with expertise across multiple medical specialties. Your role is to carefully analyze patient information and produce accurate, comprehensive medical documentation. Based on the **notes** provided, you are tasked with generating <discharge_summary> that thoroughly summarize the patient's hospital course.

Desired format:
<discharge_summary>

# Main diagnosis
[Primary diagnosis with ICD code, e.g. Primary Knee Osteoarthritis (M17.1)]

# Secondary diagnosis
[Secondary diagnosis with ICD code, e.g. Hypertension (I10)]

# Procedures
[If applicable, provide a bullet-point list of procedures. Include: Procedure name, date, and surgeon. Example:

- Total Knee Arthroplasty, 2023-08-15, Dr. Jane Smith]

# Reason for admission
[Provide a brief, focused description of why the patient was admitted.]

# Medical history
[Include only the medical history directly relevant to the current admission. Omit unrelated conditions.]

# Social history
[Include only social history that directly impacts current care or follow-up. Examples: smoking status for respiratory issues, living situation for discharge planning.]

# Hospital course
[Write in narrative style, focusing on:

-   Significant occurrences
-   Changes in condition
-   Treatment milestones
-   Key laboratory or imaging findings Organize chronologically. Use clear topic sentences for each paragraph. End with the patient's discharge destination if available.

Example: "Patient developed postoperative fever, peaking at 38.4Â°C on day 2. CRP levels increased to a maximum of 312 mg/L on postoperative day 3, then gradually decreased without antibiotic administration. This was interpreted as a normal postoperative inflammatory response."]

# Medication changes

-   New medications (with dosage and frequency)
-   Discontinued medications
-   Modified dosages of existing medications Do not include temporary medications discontinued at discharge (e.g., IV antibiotics, perioperative medications).]

# Plan

-   Follow-up appointments (with specific dates if available)
-   Specific instructions or precautions for the patient
-   Any pending tests or studies]

</discharge_summary>

Guidelines:

1.  Use professional, concise medical language with a high readability score. Avoid jargon where possible.
2.  Include only information explicitly stated in the provided **notes**. Do not infer or add information not present in the notes.
3.  Prioritize clinically significant information. Omit extraneous details that do not impact the patient's care.
4.  Clearly document key events and critical decision points in the patient's care.
5.  Highlight any changes in diagnosis or treatment plan that occurred during the hospital stay.
6.  Provide specific, actionable follow-up instructions to ensure continuity of care.
7.  Avoid repeating information across sections. Aim for a maximum of 3 paragraphs with 3-5 sentences each in the Hospital Course section. Longer summaries may be necessary for complex cases.
8.  If specific information is not available in the notes, write "Not reported" in the relevant section. Do not omit sections entirely.
9.  Use bullet points for lists (e.g., in Procedures, Plan, and Medication Changes) to enhance readability. The Hospital Course should remain in narrative form.
10. In the Hospital Course section, organize information chronologically. Use clear topic sentences for each paragraph to highlight key events or changes.

The **notes** you should base your discharge summary on are enclosed in the following triple quotes: """ {notes} """

Please generate the discharge summary based on these instructions and the provided notes.
