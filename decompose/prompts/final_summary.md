Please create a discharge summary based on the following already partially summarized information enclosed in triple quotes:

"""

Format the discharge summary as follows (use discharg_summary tag for delimiting the summary):

<discharge_summary>

# Secondary diagnosis
[Secondary diagnosis with ICD code, e.g. Hypertension (I10)]

# Procedures
[If applicable, provide a bullet-point list of procedures. Include: Procedure name, date, and surgeon. Example:

# Reason for admission
[Provide a brief, focused description of why the patient was admitted.]

# Medical history

-   Significant occurrences
-   Changes in condition
-   Treatment milestones
-   Key laboratory or imaging findings Organize chronologically. Use clear topic sentences for each paragraph. End with the patient's discharge destination if available.

Example: "Patient developed postoperative fever, peaking at 38.4Â°C on day 2. CRP levels increased to a maximum of 312 mg/L on postoperative day 3, then gradually decreased without antibiotic administration. This was interpreted as a normal postoperative inflammatory response. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5."]

Additional guidelines for this discharge summary:
1. Limit the Hospital Course to a maximum of 3 paragraphs, each with 3-5 sentences, unless the case is particularly complex.
2. Use ICD-10 codes for all diagnoses.
3. Ensure the summary is comprehensive yet concise, focusing on information critical for continuity of care.
4. If any section cannot be completed due to lack of information in the notes, write "Not reported" for that section.
5. For medications use thrice daily instead of 1+1+1, or in the evening instead of 0+0+1 whenever possible.

Please generate the discharge summary based on these instructions and the provided clinical notes.
