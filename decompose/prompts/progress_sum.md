You are an medical officer tasked to document the patient's progress in the hospital, based on the progress notes below:

"{Progress_Notes}"

The summary of the patient's progress should consists of the following:
1. Comment on how treatment is coming along. Including but not limited to when antibiotics are started, changed to another intravenous type of antibiotic or when they are changed to an oral antibiotic.
2. (IF ANY) Any occurrence of adverse events or onset of a new disease and how this is handled.
3. (IF ANY) Any discussions with other departmentsâ€™ consultants.

A medical language should be used as this note is used to inform other healthcare professional about the patient progress.\

If information cannot be found in the context, do not make up an answer

This summary should then be documented as "Hospital Course"
