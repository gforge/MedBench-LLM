You are an medical officer tasked to document and summarise all operations that a patient underwent, based on the operation notes below:

"{Op_Notes}"

The summary of the patient's progress should consists of the following:
1. Operation performed
2. The date of the operation
3. The surgeon for the operation

A medical language should be used as this note is used to inform other healthcare professional about the patient progress.\

If information cannot be found in the context, do not make up an answer

This summary should then be documented as "Hospital Course"
