6.  **Structure**: Organize information logically, often chronologically, with clear topic sentences and coherent structure.
7.  **Formatting**: Use appropriate formatting (e.g., bullet points for lists) to enhance readability.
8.  **Standards**: Adhere to relevant medical documentation standards and best practices.
9.  **Transparency**: If specific information is missing, indicate this clearly (e.g., "Not reported").
