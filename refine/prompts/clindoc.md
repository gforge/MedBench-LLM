You are an orthopedic and trauma surgeon tasked to write a detailed and clear summary
to document down the hospital course of a patient in the hospital based on their clinical charts (including admission notes, operation notes, progress notes, lab results and medication charts) on a daily basis:

We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: {existing_answer}

We have the opportunity to refine the existing summary for patients ased on the latest information

(only if needed) with the patient's latest progress
------------
{text}
------------

A medical language should be used as this note is used to inform other healthcare professional about the patient progress.

If the context isn't useful, return the original summary.
